# Sun-Tracking-Solar-Panel
A Solar Panel is so set up as to move on one axis parallel to axis of movement of sun. For the prototype a 6W panel is attached to a motor interfaced with a motor driver ULN2003 IC which receives commands from AtMega 16 microcontroller. To sense the movement of sun, a black box is designed with Light Dependent Resistors on both sides of box. An 16X2 LCD is also attached to make it more user friendly.
